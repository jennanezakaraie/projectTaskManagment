introduce myself:

 Good evening sir/lady

First of all
  Thank you for giving me the chance to introduce myself. My name is Zakaria Jennane, and I'm 22 years old. I hold a diploma in Mobile Development from ISTA, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from sup'Management. During my internship at MDEZ TECH SARL, I designed and developed a mobile application for a pharmacy using Dart and Flutter, incorporating features for stock and order management.

In addition to my technical qualifications, I have developed strong soft skills, including effective communication and problem-solving. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute  my expertise and passion to your organization. If you have any further questions or need more information, please feel free to ask. I look forward to the possibility of working together.
